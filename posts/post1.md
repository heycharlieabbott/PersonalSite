Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**.

`Array.map`

```
var add2 = function(number) {
  return number + 2;
}
```

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
